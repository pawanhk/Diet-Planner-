# new ideas
=> obviouly we'll use a graphical user interface, this time it will
be much better with more options 
=> we could maybe add a login/register page where users can register
and login with their accounts 
=> we can even add a save feature where you can save your meal pref
=> add a frinds feature where you can see what other people are 
doing 
=> maybe even have a profile page with the users information 


#math

=> same algorith we used last time to calculate the calorie count 
and stuff
